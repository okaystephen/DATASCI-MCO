#### *Members: Beaverly Cuasi, Allexandra Domingo, Angeline Gubat, Stephen Salamante, Ira Villanueva  (S12 - Couch Data Scientists)*
This notebook focuses on the Student's Academic Performance Dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data). The first section shows the dataset information and dataset cleaning process, followed by data visualization using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Lastly, this notebook aims to answer which factors affect a student’s academic grades. Specifically we wanted to know the following:
  * Do students who participate more have higher grades than those who participate less?
  * Does parent participation and satisfaction affect a student’s performance?
  * Do the number of class absences greatly affect the student’s grades?
  * Does visiting class resources result in higher class grades?
